					<h2>Welcome to my interview</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>Please use the navigation above to view each of the required tasks for this interview. Upon reviewing the instructions, I noticed that <abbr title="CodeIgniter">CI</abbr> was listed as a skill. So I chose to submit my interview in the form of a <abbr title="CodeIgniter">CI</abbr> application. Feel free to explore the source code. You will notice that I very much appreciate keeping code neat, <abbr title="Don't Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr>, and well documented. I've used <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language 5">HTML5</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets 3">CSS3</abbr> for all formatting.</p>

						<h3>My Background</h3>
					</header>
					<p>I have two degrees from NEIT. Soon after graduating my grandfather became ill, so I moved in to care for him. Unfortunately this left me unable to seriously pursue a career using my degrees. I became stuck where I currently work, which is at a group home for the mentally disabled, for the past 10 years. The hours were flexible. But, while I love it there, it no longer meets my needs with a growing family.</p>
