Unfortunately most of the portfolio from my school days has gone the way of destroyed computers(they didn't have GitHub back then or even dropbox). And as you may know from my resume I haven't had much of a chance to build a portfolio since graduating. The reason for this is because right after graduating my grandfather became ill and I chose to move in and care for him. This rendered me unable to leave my current job as it was the most flexible option while caring for my grandfather. Now that my grandfather has passed I'm looking to get back out there. I'm looking to work and build a career.

I do have some of the design work if you're interested in that.

The best example I can point you to right now is madalynaslan.com. It is a custom website I built and manage for an astrologer. It's running off of Wordpress on a LEMP stack.

And if that isn't enough, feel free to test me. I'm more than willing to brush the dust off my shoulders and touch up on whatever you need me to touch up on.

Given the chance, I feel I could become a great asset to anyone willing to test me.

Sincerely,
Jay Fletcher
