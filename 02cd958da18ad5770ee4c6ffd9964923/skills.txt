First off let me say thank you for this opportunity. I have graded my skills honestly based on where they are currently. To be honest it has been a few years since I've had to some real coding, so I'm a bit rusty. 

That being said, I want you to know that I am willing to learn and willing to work very hard. I am very motivated. 

Again, Thank you for this opportunity. Below are the skill ratings.

Sincerely,
Jay Fletcher
